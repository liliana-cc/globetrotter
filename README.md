### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics discussed in the labs were very relevant to the project we completed. Some relevant topics I used from the labs included flex-box, justify-position, align-items, stacking id's classes & tags, among many more. I think I felt more unprepared to complete the visual design aspect of this weekly assignment. Visual design is not something I've dabbled in much, so it was very intimidating to complete, especially being new to CSS. While I dont think my output is perfect or the best looking, I did my best using what I learned from the labs, my peers, and by leveraging AI so that I could better understand what each component's purpose was, so I feel quite pleased with myself.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have loved to add animations for my content boxes, however, I believe that is more javascript related, which we haven't gone over yet. Hopefully, in the near future I will be able to experiment with those features more in order to make interactive and entertaining websites!

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Because of the labs, I was able to complete the project using that knowledge. This came especially useful in creating the wireframe for my website as I could plan out where all of my tags would be before designing. On the other hand, designing was more difficult and creatively challenging for me, especially new concepts like the flex-box and flex grid. I was able to overcome this setback with the help of advisors and peers. Something one of my peers did that I thought was amazing was a sliding image album, I think the concept is neat and would love to learn how to incorporate that into future websites.
